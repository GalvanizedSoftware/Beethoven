1. Methods conditions
1. Auto-assign properties on contruction (IOC / Manual)
1. Auto-resolve method values based on type and name
1. Fallback properties and methods
1. Add Implements<TInterface, TClass> to help duck-typing
1. Check performance (it's bad, but how bad?)
1. *Example:* Multiple "inheritance"
1. Compile generated code without Castle or IInvocation
1. Generate code file for compilation
1. Implement test property indexers (not very important _IMHO_)
