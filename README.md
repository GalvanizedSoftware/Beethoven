# Beethoven
Beethoven project

Composing classes in fluet-style programming.
Frequently used implementations can be reused without inheritance.
Not using inheritance enables inclusion of the code actually needed, not a vast base-class, or a library of classes.

Fluent programming har so far been limited to methods on classes. This projects motivation is to extent the fluent-style to class code.
