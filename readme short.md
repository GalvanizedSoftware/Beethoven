Composing classes in fluet-style programming.
Frequently used implementations can be reused without inheritance.
Not using inheritance enables inclusion of the code actually needed.
Inheritance can lead to a vast class inheritance strucure.

The starting point of this project was the fluent programming style to import code.
But it turned out there were many more possibilities ...

* Fluent programming style
* Auto-mapping
* Default implementation
* Modifying existing implementation
* Duck typing
* Interface conversion
