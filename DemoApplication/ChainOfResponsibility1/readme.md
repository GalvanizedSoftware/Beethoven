# Chain of Responsibility 1
Once I made this I realized it's not a really chain of respnsibility.\
Even though the code essentially does the same, the objects are not linked within the class.\
Note the return value looks inverted compared to the logical result of ```Approve```, the return value indicates if the chain of methods should continue.
